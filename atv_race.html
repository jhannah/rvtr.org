<h1>Sat Sep 28 2013 - ATV Race</h1>

<p>We've confirmed with <a href="http://www.unitedoffroadracing.com/13schedules.php">OMA Nationals</a>
that they will be holding a <b>non-points</b> ATV race at our park the day before the motorcycle
points race.</p>

<p>Their website does not list this race because it is <b>non-points</b> and they don't want
to confuse their points riders with this late addition to their season.</p>

<p>More details to come as the event draws closer.</p>
