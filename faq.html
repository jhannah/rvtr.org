<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<a name="need">
<h3>What do I need to ride in the park?</h3>
<ul>
<li>A current <a href="http://www.iowadnr.gov/Recreation/AllTerrainVehiclesATV/ATVRegistration.aspx">Iowa DNR sticker</a> on your vehicle, and the paperwork that came with it. 
You need to carry the paperwork with you while riding. 
<a href="http://goo.gl/maps/9jIso">Our map</a> shows some of the closest places you can buy stickers.
<li>Follow all Iowa DNR <a href="http://www.iowadnr.gov/Recreation/AllTerrainVehiclesATV/ATVParkRulesandLocations.aspx">OHV Park Rules</a> (scroll to bottom, click the link). 
</ul>
<p>
That's it! You do not need to be a club member to ride the park.

<h3>Why is the park closed?</h3>
<p>
The park is <b>open</b> every day it can be, all year. 
Almost all closures are due to the entrance trail being so muddy
that when a few inconsiderate riders gun their machines they leave deep ruts 
that would remain weeks / months after the ground dries. These ruts are a hazard to novice riders
who are just trying to ride their 50cc bikes to the flats. 
</p><p>
We want people to have fun "mudding." 
But we need them to do it in the large flat areas / culverts / ditches / sand.
It takes countless hours of work to repair the entrance trail every time it gets trenched on rain
soaked days. 
</p><p>
We all want to ride. But we don't control the weather. Please help spread the word:
tread lightly on the entrance trail!
</p><p>
Also keep in mind that our land is some of the wettest land anywhere. It's the flood plain of the
river <i>inside</i> the levy, and our entrance trail is, unfortunately, some of the lowest, 
wettest land in our park. Put some boots on and go walk our entrance trail -- you may be 
surprised to find that our entrance trail is a mud hole long after your back yard feels dry.

<a name="updates">
<h3>How do I stay informed?</h3>
We post all announcements and updates in four places: 
here (RVTR.org),
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/197392583709924/">FaceBook</a>, 
our <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/RiverValleyTrailRiders">e-mail list</a>, 
and via SMS text messaging. 
Please use whichever of those you find convenient. 
<a href="mailto:secretary@rvtr.org" target="_blank">Email us your phone number</a> if you want to be added to the SMS list.
<p>
And/or you can call our park info hotline: 402-478-8701, or a 
<a href="officers.html">club officer</a>. 
(The Iowa DNR hotline is often wrong, please don't rely on it.)

<a name="members">
<h3>What do club members do?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Park maintenance: work days, ongoing.</li>
<li>Club meetings: budgets, maintenance policies, equipment, etc.</li>
<li>Special events: races, other?</li>
<li>Club members <b>do not</b> set park policies. We <b>do not</b> enforce rules or safety violations.  Please contact <a href="http://www.iowadnr.gov/Recreation/AllTerrainVehiclesATV/ATVParkRulesandLocations.aspx">Iowa DNR</a> with any such concerns.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Club members are individuals willing to put in the work to keep the park open for everyone to 
enjoy. This includes the physical labor of clearing down trees off of trails, and the 
organizational labor of interfacing with the Iowa DNR regarding equipment maintenance, budgets,
policy discussions, special events, incidents, insurance, etc.
</p>
<p>
Membership is annual. $20 for individual, $40 for family. 
Membership gives you access to, and a vote in, club meetings.
It gets you park access on members-only work days and ride days. 
And gets you free entry into all club-sponsored events. 
</p>
<p>
Membership enrollment is always open. 
An enrollment form should be online soon. 
In the mean time, you can always contact any <a href="officers.html">club officer</a>,
or simply show up at the next event, always listed on our website (here), FaceBook, and
our email mailing list.
